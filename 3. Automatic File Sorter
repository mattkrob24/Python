# This project uses Python to create an automatic file sorter to examine a folder containing a large amount of unorganized files of various types such as CSV, Text, and images

# The code below simultaneously creates folders and moves the files into their respective folders

# This was completed on a Mac in Jupyter Notebooks using a specified path to the folder on my computer where the files were stored and subsequently organized



import os, shutil

path = r'/Users/matthewrobinson/Desktop/PythonFileSort/'

os.listdir(path)

for folder in folder_names:
    if not os.path.exists(path + folder):
        os.makedirs(path + folder)

file_names = os.listdir(path)

for file in file_names:
    if '.csv' in file and not os.path.exists(path + "CSV Files/" + file):
        shutil.move(path + file, path + "CSV Files/" + file)
    elif '.png' in file and not os.path.exists(path + "Image Files/" + file):
        shutil.move(path + file, path + "Image Files/" + file)
    elif '.txt' in file and not os.path.exists(path + "Text Files/" + file):
        shutil.move(path + file, path + "Text Files/" + file)
