# This project was completed to scrape data from Martin Luther King Jr's Speech (on AnalyticTech) using Python in Jupyter Notebooks

# This code pulls the speech using the HTML from the site
# The scraped data was then split into individual words and counted in a DataFrame in Pandas and then exported to a CSV

# Python Skills Used: Regular Expressions, Web Scraping, Pandas, Data Cleaning & Manipulation, File Handling

# SKIP TO BOTTOM FOR FINAL CODE



# THE PROCESS IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
